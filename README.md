# Language Translator Application

This is a simple GUI-based language translator application built using Python. It allows users to translate text from one language to another using the `deep_translator` library and provides the translated text on the interface.

## Features

- **Translation:** Supports translation between multiple languages including Hindi, English, Japanese, and Malayalam.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Built using `tkinter` for easy interaction.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Although planned, currently the application focuses on text translation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `deep_translator` library for translation
- `gtts` library for text-to-speech conversion (if planning to extend the project)
- `tkinter` for the GUI (usually included with Python)
